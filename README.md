# Software Engineering Courses

The goal of this repository is to provide an overview on open courses on software engineering. The idea is to help lecturers to get an overview on publicly available courses but also to make others aware of their own courses.

There are multiple reasons to make materials for courses publicly available and individual reasons of lecturers may vary. For lecturers, it may lead to a larger outreach for their efforts in creating course materials and they can also reuse and extend materials by others. For participants, it may lead to higher quality materials or those with more up-to-date examples if lecturers collaborate.

The current focus is on courses in English or German language. Most of the currently linked courses are designed for bachelor's and master's students with a computer science background. For each course it differs which materials are actually shared; most courses come with a non-editable version of slides (e.g., PDF files) while others may accompanied by source files (e.g., ODP, PPTX, TEX files), exercises or even videos (e.g., on Youtube).
